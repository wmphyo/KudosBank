                <h3>Question 1</h3> 
                <p>When an organism is buried shortly after its death, it fills with groundwater that contains many minerals. Over time, these minerals precipitate, forming detailed fossils that can reveal fascinating structural information about the organism. Oftentimes, the original remains of the organism dissolve over time so all that remains is the fossil. Over many years, several layers of material can form sediment over the fossilized organism, burying it even further. Each of these layers is representative of a particular time period. Through carbon dating, scientists can determine when a particular layer of sedimentary rock was formed. If a particular organism was fossilized in that layer, the scientists can deduce that that organism most likely lived during that time period. The half-life of carbon-14 (the radioactive isotope of carbon) is approximately 5,000 years. The following diagram depicts several rock layers.</p>

                <h3>Question 2</h3>
                <p>A year is the length of time it takes for a planet to complete one entire orbit around the Sun.</p>

                <h3>Question 3</h3>
                <p>Our solar system includes our Sun, as well as the planets and other objects that orbit it. It was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago and contains eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Originally, Pluto was classified as the ninth planet and farthest from the Sun; however, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union redefined the necessary characteristics of a planet and in doing so excluded Pluto. The Sun contains 99.9% of the mass of the solar system and thus induces the other planets to orbit around it. The four innermost planets encircling the Sun are relatively small. Immediately beyond them in the solar system is a rocky asteroid belt. Looking farther out in the solar system one can find the largest planets, known as the gas giants. Many of the planets have secondary systems that include moons or planetary ring systems. The following graph indicates the temperatures found on each planet based on its location relative to the Sun. The maximum temperature in Kelvin is reported.</p>

                <h3>Question 4</h3>
                <p>During periods of intense activity, the cells of the body need more oxygen than the body is supplying, a situation known as oxygen debt. During these periods, the body’s cells briefly switch to “anaerobic respiration,” which produces lactic acid. The buildup of lactic acid in the tissues signals the brain to increase breathing and heart rates, thus supplying the body with more oxygen.</p>

                <h3>Question 10</h3>
                <p>To test a new voice feature in a cockpit design a flight simulator was used. The simulator was programmed to give visual readings of flight information, or to give visual and auditory (voice) readings of flight information. A hundred test pilots were put through a simulated emergency landing procedure, but were randomly assigned to the visual, or visual and auditory conditions. Ten flight experts rated each pilot’s performance in the simulator on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent).</p>

                <h3>Question 7</h3>
                <p>The United States can be characterized as a Presidential Democracy and Great Britain can be characterized as a Parliamentary Democracy. While both the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great Britain head the executive branch of their respective governments, there are some significant differences between them. The British prime minister is elected by voters from one parliamentary district, then chosen by members of Parliament. The U.S. president is elected by all of a country’s voters via the electoral college system. The British prime minister serves a maximum term of five years before new elections must be held, but there is no limit on the number of terms that may be served. In contrast, the U.S. president serves a maximum of two four-year terms.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>The leaders also differ in terms of the powers they exert over other parts of the government. The U.S. president appoints members of the cabinet, with Senate approval, and can fire people without approval. The British prime minister appoints and fires members of cabinet, although the monarch must approve those decisions. The U.S. president cannot disband Congress and force new elections, but the British prime minister can disband Parliament and force new elections. The U.S. president also has the power to veto bills, while the British prime minister does not have the power to veto bills.    </p>

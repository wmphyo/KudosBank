                Mr. Lamond is retiring at the end of the year and his company, MegaGraphics, will be closing, but he
                feels that my talents would be of great use to you.

            <p class="line-space">
                I have a proven track record as a graphics designer with MegaGraphics. I began there as an intern in
                2010, after graduating with honors from the University of Washington, Seattle.
            </p>
            <p class="line-space">
                Due to my excellent work, productivity, and reliability,
                <select name="options" id="ans2">

                </select>
                As a graphics designer, I created logos and promotional materials, and I designed social media
                campaigns for several clients to establish their brands. My work repeatedly produced successful results.

                All of my clients expressed satisfaction with my work, citing my ability to think quickly, listen
                closely, and create unique work. I am happy to provide references from several of these clients.

                from my talents.

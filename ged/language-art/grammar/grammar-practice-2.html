            <p class="line-space">
                Every year, thousands of dogs and cats are abused or abandoned by their owners. Left without food or
                shelter,
                these animals become sick and even die. In addition, most are not spayed or neutered, so they can
                produce litters of
                puppies and kittens that will also be without a home. This creates a vicious cycle.

                Studies have repeatedly shown how beneficial pets are.

            <p class="line-space">The Barstock Animal Shelter provides several important services at no cost before you even choose your
                pet. An
                animal behaviorist evaluates each of our animals to assess any behavioral problems. Each animal also
                receives a full
                medical examination and rabies vaccination by a licensed veterinarian. In addition, the veterinarian
                will spay or neuter
                the animal, if necessary. Only after

                Before you visit the animals, a pet adoption counselor will have you fill out an application to
                help match you with the right pet. The questions asked, for example, are, Do you have small children? Do
                you prefer a
                quieter pet or a more active one? Would you like a younger or an older pet?
